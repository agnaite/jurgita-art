			Coming from Kaunas, Lithuania, Jurgita ventured on to living in Berlin, Dubai, and throughout the US, which has influenced her work making her the true spirit of an international artist.  She first was inspired to pick up a paint brush when she moved to Dubai and was dazzled by the culture that eludes of a Bedouin era and yet has set the foundation that defines the new world through architectural innovation.  Having been accepted as a talented artist, the Royal Family quickly became a patron buying her work for their palaces and commercial buildings. She has since gone on to exhibiting and selling throughout the world.
